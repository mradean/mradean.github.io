## Direct instalation in ```Stata```

If this is the first time you are installing user-written programs from internet, you may find it useful to read the official ```Stata``` <a href="https://www.stata.com/manuals/rnet.pdf">documentation</a>. There you can find details about the commands used below as well as information about the directories where the downloaded packages should be installed.

To open the content page telling you about the available software packages on my website, type the following in ```Stata```'s command window 

```stata
. net from https://mariusradean.org
```

To open the package-description page detailing one of the listed packages and how to install the associated component files, type ```net describe``` followed by the package name. _pkgname_ may be any of the available software packages, ie, ```ginteff.pkg```, ```ginteffplot.pkg```, or ```sdii.pkg```.

<pre>
. net describe <i>pkgname</i>
</pre>

If you decide that one of the packages might prove useful, you can install the official files (the ado-file and help file) by typing ```net install``` followed by the package name.

<pre>
. net install <i>pkgname</i>
</pre>

To get the ancillary file (the user's manual in PDF format), type ```net get``` followed by the package name.

<pre>
. net get <i>pkgname</i>
</pre>

Instead of typing ```net describe```, ```net install```, or ```net get``` command lines, you can alternatively click on the links provided on the content and package-description pages.
